## ⚙️ How It Works

This is a static front-end project. It does **not** include any backend logic or user authentication. Here's what happens:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page layout.
2. The layout adjusts on different devices using media queries, making it mobile and tablet friendly.
3. UI components like the banner, content rows, and FAQ are styled to look like Netflix.
4. Visual assets (images/videos) are fetched via CDN links.
5. You can explore how a real-world landing page is structured and styled using pure HTML and CSS.
